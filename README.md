Q2:What is the difference between maxn and 5w on jetson nano.
Maxn means that we are setting the jetson nano to function at maximum performance as compared to the 5w option which is equivalent to a low power mode.

Q3:What challenges did you face face during the setup and how did you overcome them.
Our original keyboards and mouse were incompatible with the ports on the jetson nano which led to technical complications. Thus leading to the borrowing of lab equipment to fully set up the lab.

Q4:Can you think of a real-world problem that could be solved using the Jetson Nano? Describe how you would design and implement a solution.
A real world problem that can be solved using the jetson nano would be building autonomous machines that can solve issues that require constant attention such as agricultural needs. More specifically, robots that can remove weeds that is seen or it can spot whether produce is not acceptable for sale.
